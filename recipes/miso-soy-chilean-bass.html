        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This Chilean sea bass recipe is melt-in-your-mouth delicious!
        I had it at Blue Water Grill in NYC, and it was by far the best sea 
        bass I've ever had in my life. This recipe tastes very close to what 
        I had at that restaurant. They served it with bok choy and sticky 
        rice on the side.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>⅓ cup sake</li>
            <li>⅓ cup mirin (Japanese sweet rice wine)</li>
            <li>⅓ cup miso paste</li>
            <li>¼ cup packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>4 (4 ounce) fillets fresh sea bass, about 1 inch thick</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped green onion</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk together sake, mirin, miso paste, brown sugar, and soy 
                sauce in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Place sea bass fillets in a large resealable plastic bag; 
                pour marinade over fillets. Chill in the refrigerator for 3 
                to 6 hours.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 
                inches from the heat source. Prop the oven door to remain 
                slightly ajar.</li>
            <li>Arrange fillets on a baking sheet; discard marinade.</li>
            <li>Broil sea bass in the preheated oven until fish 
                flakes easily with a fork, 7 to 9 minutes.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle with chopped green onions to serve.</li>
        </ol>
