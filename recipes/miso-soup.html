            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol class="steps">
                <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
                <li>Pour cold water into a saucepan. Add kombu and 
                    soak for 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Set pan on the stove over medium heat, and wait until
                    water just starts to simmer. 
                    Turn off heat, and remove kombu with a strainer. 
                    Squeeze out any liquid back into the pan, and 
                    discard kombu.</li>
                <li>Turn heat back on to med-high, and bring to a simmer.
                    Stir bonito flakes into the simmering liquid, 
                    and turn off the heat. Let sit for 10 minutes, 
                    before staining and reserving the liquid, also known
                    as the "dashi."</li>
                <li>Pour dashi into a saucepan over medium heat. 
                    Add pre-soaked, shredded seaweed, soy sauce, and 
                    green onions. Bring to a simmer, and reduce heat to 
                    low. Place a small strainer over the pan, and add 
                    miso pastes. Submerge strainer halfway down into the 
                    hot dashi, and stir slowly until all the miso has 
                    dissolved and passed through into the soup.</li>
                <li>Serve immediately with sliced green onions on top.</li>
